# Truth_or_Bluff
It helps us to know if a person is telling us truth about his previous salary or not.

In this Machine Learning problem (implemented using polynomial regression) we work as helping hand for hr department of a company.

In our company there is a job available for Region Manager and we receives a application who tells hr department that he has a experience of 20 years and earned 160,000 on his previous job. Now hr want to hire him but he want to see if he bluffed or told truth about his previous salary.So, from his contacts he managed to get starting salaries for different levels in that company. Now our job is to tell hr by looking at given data whether the person told truth about his salary or not.
